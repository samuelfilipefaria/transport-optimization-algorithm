Imagine a transport company that has a few trucks and a lot of objects to deliver. Each truck has a limit weight of charge, and each object has a weight and a given profit if the object is delivered. The company needs to optimize its gains, so it's necessary to deliver the objects while gaining as much money as possible. The algorithm helps with that by analyzing objects and a truck and deciding which objects should be carried in order to get the biggest possible profit.
